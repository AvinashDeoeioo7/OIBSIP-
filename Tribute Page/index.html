        <div class="leftsection">
             A.P.J.Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

             While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

            <p>Kalam's early life was marked by hardship and financial constraints, but he was a bright student with a keen interest in science. He graduated in physics from St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, and later specialized in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology.

                His remarkable career began at the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he played pivotal roles in the development of India's space and missile programs. He played a significant part in the successful development of the indigenous satellite launch vehicle SLV-III and the nuclear-capable ballistic missile Agni.
                
                Kalam's exceptional contributions to India's space and defense programs earned him great respect and admiration from the scientific community. However, he became a household name when he played a key role as the Chief Project Coordinator for India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as a nuclear power.
                
                Apart from his scientific endeavors, Abdul Kalam was also passionate about inspiring the youth and promoting education. He believed in the power of knowledge and technology to uplift the nation and its people. Throughout his life, he interacted extensively with students and young minds, encouraging them to pursue science and dream big for their country.
                
                In 2002, Kalam was elected as the President of India, a largely ceremonial role, but he used the position to continue his vision of inspiring the youth and promoting education, particularly in rural areas. His presidency was marked by simplicity, accessibility, and a strong connection with the masses.
                
                Tragically, on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and passed away due to a cardiac arrest. His death was deeply mourned not only in India but also around the world. Kalam's legacy as a scientist, leader, and visionary continues to inspire generations, and he is remembered as a symbol of selfless service, dedication, and the pursuit of knowledge for the betterment of society.</p>
